  # Executes the given block only after obtaining an exclusive lock on the

  #
  # EXPLANATION
  # ===========
  #
  # If two or more rolling deploys were to execute simultanously, there is a
  # possibility that all instances could be detached from the load balancer
  # at the same time.
  #
  # Although we check that other instances are attached before detaching, there
  # could be a case where a deploy was running simultaneously on each instance
  # of a pair. A race would then be possible where each machine sees the
  # presence of the other instance and then both are detached. Now the load
  # balancer has no instances to send traffic to
  #
  # Result: downtime and disaster.
  #
  # By executing the code within the context of a lock on a shared global deploy
  # mutex, deploys are forced to run in serial, and only one machine is detached
  # at a time.
  #
  # Result: disaster averted.
